# odin-recipes
My first ever html project! This project will emulate a recipe page, where the user is presented with recipes needed to cook delicious food!

Reflection:

+I was able to successfully use multiple files and link them together by using <a> tags to seamlessly navigate through one file to another 

+I was able to use basic css elements to experiment with the possiblities of CSS on a HTML file

-For now since I am a beginner I am using very basic CSS but I intend to become better and as a result grow as a developer
